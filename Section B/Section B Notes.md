### Notes:
A JDK interpreter will be required to execute this files as is Java and has src files
The location of the src files is:
Code_Reviewer_Assessment/Sectio B/IncomeTaxCalculator/src/tax/calculator
Both Java Source Files "IncomeTax" and "IncomeTaxGUI" do different tasks and also take inputs differently
